# To be done

  - Remove the CentOS dependency for the salt-master (yum can be installed through `apt`)
  - Missing SSL for ldap
  - Missing iptables
  - Missing interconnect (need hardware)
  - Missing PXE and Basic configuration files generator scrip (dialog based)
  - Missing basic probes for Shinken
  - Debian and SLES integration (pkgs only today, and nothing inside)
